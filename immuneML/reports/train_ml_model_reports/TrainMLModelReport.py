    Train ML model reports plot general statistics or export data of multiple models simultaneously when running the :ref:`TrainMLModel` instruction.

        Concrete classes inheriting TrainMLModelReport may include additional parameters that will be set by the user in the form of input arguments.
        name (str): user-defined name of the report used in the HTML overview automatically generated by the platform
        state (TrainMLModelState): a state object that includes all the information, trained models, encodings and datasets from the nested cross-validation procedure used to train the optimal model.
        result_path (Path): location where the report results will be stored
        number_of_processes (int): how many processes should be created at once to speed up the analysis. For personal machines, 4 or 8 is usually a good choice.
