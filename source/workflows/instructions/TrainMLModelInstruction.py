class TrainMLModelInstruction(Instruction):
    """
    Class implementing hyperparameter optimization and training and assessing the model through nested cross-validation (CV).
    The process is defined by two loops:

        - the outer loop over defined splits of the dataset for performance assessment

        - the inner loop over defined hyperparameter space and with cross-validation or train & validation split
          to choose the best hyperparameters.

    Optimal model chosen by the inner loop is then retrained on the whole training dataset in the outer loop.

    Arguments:

        dataset (Dataset): dataset to use for training and assessing the classifier

        hp_strategy (HPOptimizationStrategy): how to search different hyperparameters; common options include grid search, random search. Valid values are objects of any class inheriting :py:obj:`~source.hyperparameter_optimization.strategy.HPOptimizationStrategy.HPOptimizationStrategy`.

        hp_settings (list): a list of combinations of `preprocessing_sequence`, `encoding` and `ml_method`. `preprocessing_sequence` is optional, while `encoding` and `ml_method` are mandatory. These three options (and their parameters) can be optimized over, choosing the highest performing combination.

        assessment (SplitConfig): description of the outer loop (for assessment) of nested cross-validation. It describes how to split the data, how many splits to make, what percentage to use for training and what reports to execute on those splits. See SplitConfig.

        selection (SplitConfig): description of the inner loop (for selection) of nested cross-validation. The same as assessment argument, just to be executed in the inner loop. See SplitConfig.

        metrics (list): a list of metrics to compute for all splits and settings created during the nested cross-validation. These metrics will be computed only for reporting purposes. For choosing the optimal setting, `optimization_metric` will be used.

        optimization_metric (Metric): a metric to use for optimization and assessment in the nested cross-validation.

        label_configuration (LabelConfiguration): a list of labels for which to train the classifiers. The goal of the nested CV is to find the
        setting which will have best performance in predicting the given label (e.g., if a subject has experienced an immune event or not).
        Performance and optimal settings will be reported for each label separately. If a label is binary, instead of specifying only its name, one
        should explicitly set the name of the positive class as well under parameter `positive_class`. If positive class is not set, one of the label
        classes will be assumed to be positive.

        batch_size (int): how many processes should be created at once to speed up the analysis. For personal machines, 4 or 8 is usually a good choice.

        data_reports (list): a list of reports to be executed on the whole dataset.

        refit_optimal_model (bool): if the final combination of preprocessing-encoding-ML model should be refitted on the full dataset thus providing
        the final model to be exported from instruction; alternatively, train combination from one of the assessment folds will be used
