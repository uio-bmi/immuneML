class ReportConfig:
    """
    A class encapsulating different report lists which can be executed while performing nested cross-validation (CV) using TrainMLModel
    instruction. All arguments are optional.

    Arguments:

        data_splits (dict): reports to be executed after the data has been split into training and test (assessment CV loop) or training and validation (selection CV loop) datasets before they are encoded

        models (dict): reports to be executed on all trained classifiers

        data (dict): reports to be executed on the whole dataset before it is split to training/test or training/validation

        encoding (dict): reports to be executed on the encoded training/test datasets or training/validation datasets

        hyperparameter (dict): reports to be executed after the nested CV has finished to show the overall performance; this parameter can only be
        specified under assessment key in TrainMLModel instruction.
