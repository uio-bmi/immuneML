Class implementing hyperparameter optimization and training and assessing the model through nested cross-validation (CV).
The process is defined by two loops:

- the outer loop over defined splits of the dataset for performance assessment

- the inner loop over defined hyperparameter space and with cross-validation or train & validation split
  to choose the best hyperparameters.

Optimal model chosen by the inner loop is then retrained on the whole training dataset in the outer loop.

.. note::

    If you are interested in plotting the performance of all combinations of encodings and ML methods on the test set,
    consider running the :ref:`MLSettingsPerformance` report as hyperparameter report in the assessment loop.


**Specification arguments:**

- dataset: dataset to use for training and assessing the classifier

- strategy: how to search different hyperparameters; common options include grid search, random search. Valid values are: `GridSearch`.

- settings (list): a list of combinations of `preprocessing_sequence`, `encoding` and `ml_method`. `preprocessing_sequence` is optional, while `encoding` and `ml_method` are mandatory. These three options (and their parameters) can be optimized over, choosing the highest performing combination.

- assessment: description of the outer loop (for assessment) of nested cross-validation. It describes how to split the data, how many splits to make, what percentage to use for training and what reports to execute on those splits. See plitConfig below.

- selection: description of the inner loop (for selection) of nested cross-validation. The same as assessment argument, just to be executed in the inner loop. See plitConfig below.

- metrics (list): a list of metrics (`accuracy`, `balanced_accuracy`, `confusion_matrix`, `f1_micro`, `f1_macro`, `f1_weighted`, `precision`, `recall`, `auc`, `log_loss`) to compute for all splits and settings created during the nested cross-validation. These metrics will be computed only for reporting purposes. For choosing the optimal setting, `optimization_metric` will be used.

- optimization_metric: a metric to use for optimization (one of `accuracy`, `balanced_accuracy`, `confusion_matrix`, `f1_micro`, `f1_macro`, `f1_weighted`, `precision`, `recall`, `auc`, `log_loss`) and assessment in the nested cross-validation.

- example_weighting: which example weighting strategy to use. Example weighting can be used to up-weight or down-weight the importance of each example in the dataset. These weights will be applied when computing (optimization) metrics, and are used by some encoders and ML methods.

- labels (list): a list of labels for which to train the classifiers. The goal of the nested CV is to find the
  setting which will have best performance in predicting the given label (e.g., if a subject has experienced an immune event or not).
  Performance and optimal settings will be reported for each label separately. If a label is binary, instead of specifying only its name, one
  should explicitly set the name of the positive class as well under parameter `positive_class`. If positive class is not set, one of the label
  classes will be assumed to be positive.

- number_of_processes (int): how many processes should be created at once to speed up the analysis. For personal machines, 4 or 8 is usually a good choice.

- reports (list): a list of report names to be executed after the nested CV has finished to show the overall performance or some statistic;
  the reports that can be provided here are :ref:`**Train ML model reports**`.

- refit_optimal_model (bool): if the final combination of preprocessing-encoding-ML model should be refitted on the full dataset thus providing
  the final model to be exported from instruction; alternatively, train combination from one of the assessment folds will be used

- export_all_models (bool): if set to True, all trained models in the assessment split are exported as .zip files.
  If False, only the optimal model is exported. By default, export_all_models is False.

- sequence_type (str): whether to perform the analysis on amino acid or nucleotide sequences

- region_type (str): which part of the sequence to analyze, e.g., IMGT_CDR3

**SplitConfig**

SplitConfig describes how to split the data for cross-validation. It allows for the following combinations:

- loocv (leave-one-out cross-validation)

- k_fold (k-fold cross-validation)

- stratified_k_fold (stratified k-fold cross-validation that can be used when immuneML is used for single-label
  classification, see `this documentation <https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.StratifiedKFold.html>`_ for more details on how this is implemented)

- random (Monte Carlo cross-validation - randomly splitting the dataset to training and test datasets)

- manual (train and test dataset are explicitly specified by providing metadata files for the two datasets)

- leave_one_out_stratification (leave-one-out CV where one refers to a specific parameter, e.g. if subject is known
  in a receptor dataset, it is possible to have leave-subject-out CV; or if a dataset contains multiple batches, it
  is possible to split evaluation by batch).

**Specification arguments:**

- split_strategy: one of the types of cross-validation listed above (`LOOCV`, `K_FOLD`, `STRATIFIED_K_FOLD`, `MANUAL`, ``  or `RANDOM`)

- split_count (int): if split_strategy is `K_FOLD`, then this defined how many splits to make (K), if split_strategy is RANDOM, split_count defines how many random splits to make, resulting in split_count training/test dataset pairs, or if split_strategy is `LOOCV`, `MANUAL` or `LEAVE_ONE_OUT_STRATIFICATION`, split_count does not need to be specified.

- training_percentage: if split_strategy is RANDOM, this defines which portion of the original dataset to use for creating the training dataset; for other values of split_strategy, this parameter is not used.

- reports: defines which reports to execute on which datasets or settings. See ReportConfig for more details.

- manual_config: if split strategy is `MANUAL`,
  here the paths to metadata files should be given (fields `train_metadata_path` and `test_metadata_path`). The matching of examples is done
  using the "subject_id" field in for repertoire datasets so it has to be present in both the original dataset and the metadata files provided
  here. For receptor and sequence datasets, "example_id" field needs to be provided in the metadata files and it will be mapped to either
  'sequence_identifiers' or 'receptor_identifiers' in the original dataset. If split strategy is anything other than `MANUAL`, this field has
  no effect and can be omitted.

- leave_one_out_config: if split strategy is
  `LEAVE_ONE_OUT_STRATIFICATION`, this config describes which parameter to use for stratification thus making a list of train/test dataset
  combinations in which in the test set there are examples with only one value of the specified parameter. `leave_one_out_config` argument
  accepts two inputs: `parameter` which is the name of the parameter to use for stratification and `min_count` which defines the minimum
  number of examples that can be present in the test dataset. This type of generating train and test datasets is only supported for receptor
  and sequence datasets so far. If split strategy is anything else, this field has no effect and can be omitted.
