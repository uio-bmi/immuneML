   :twitter:title: immuneML use case: extending immuneML with a deep learning component for predicting antigen specificity of paired receptor data
   :twitter:description: See how immuneML was extended with a deep learning component for predicting antigen specificity of paired receptor data in the immuneML manuscript.

To demonstrate how immuneML can be extended, we added a convolutional neural network (CNN) for predicting receptor specificity. To show how it can be
using alongside existing components, we compared the CNN with k-nearest neighbour classifier based on TCRdist distance and a
logistic regression model on 3-mer frequencies. We also show the motifs extracted by CNN, TCRdist
(`Mayer-Blackwell et al. 2020 <https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.24.424260v1>`_, `Dash et al. 2017 <https://www.nature.com/articles/nature22383>`_) and GLIPH2
(`Huang et al. 2020 <https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-020-0505-4>`_) for the datasets we examine.

This use-case description includes the description of the datasets, how to add a CNN model, how to compare CNN with other models and finally, how to
extract motifs from models.

The complete collection of original files used in this use case can be found in the NIRD research data archive (DOI: `10.11582/2021.00009 <https://doi.org/10.11582/2021.00009>`_).
Note that the YAML specifications in the original dataset were compatible with immuneML version 1.1.1.
This documentation page contains the YAML specifications for equivalent analyses with the latest immuneML version (last tested with version 1.1.4).

Preparing the datasets
-----------------------

We used three epitope-specific datasets to compare the performance of CNN, TCRdist classifier and logistic regression. The epitope-specific paired chain
receptors were downloaded from VDJdb for epitopes:

- AVFDRKSDAK (Epstein-Barr virus): the original file is available here: :download:`AVFDRKSDAK.tsv <../_static/files/AVFDRKSDAK-EBV-Human-TCRAB_paired-2020-12-23 15_07_08.331.tsv>`
- GILGFVFTL (Influenza A): the original file is available here: :download:`GILGFVFTL.tsv <../_static/files/GILGFVFTL-InfluenzaA-Human-TCRAB_paired-2020-12-23 15_06_16.244.tsv>`
- KLGGALQAK (Cytomegalovirus): the original file is available here: :download:`KLGGALQAK.tsv <../_static/files/KLGGALQAK-CMV-epitope-Human-TCRAB_paired-2020-12-23 15_04_46.165.tsv>`

Naive unpaired T-cell receptor data was downloaded from the immuneACCESS database from the study by `Heikkil√§ et al. 2020 <http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016158902030479X>`_. It consisted of naive PBMC
TCRAB data from 4 healthy donors that where then randomly paired if coming from the same donor, as described also by Dash et al. 2017 for generation of
background receptors. The receptors missing the V- or J-gene information (even though in some cases gene subgroup might have been know),
receptors shorter than 6 amino acids and receptors containing V- or J-gene information for which the mapping was not available in TCRdist3 were
removed. The removed genes due to TCRdist3 availablility were: TCRAV37-01\*01, TCRBV07-05\*02, TCRAV28-01, TCRAV31-01\*01, TCRBV07-05, TCRAV33-01\*01,
TCRAV32-01\*01, TCRBVA-or09_02, TCRBV22-01.

The original data file as downloaded from immuneACCESS is available here: :download:`naiveTCRAB.tsv <../_static/files/Heikkila et al 2020 naive PBMC TCRAB immuneACCESS 20201223.tsv>`

Using this data, three datasets were created by combining epitope-specific paired receptor data with naive randomly paired data. These data along with
the results of testing are available in `NIRD research data archive <http://doi.org/10.11582/2021.00009>`_.

Adding a new ML method
-----------------------

We proposed a CNN model adapted to the receptor specificity prediction problem. Briefly, an adaptive immune receptor consists of two chains, two receptor
(amino acid) sequences forming a 3D structure. This receptor can either bind an antigen (e.g., part of a virus) and trigger an immune response or not.
The ability to predict if receptor binds an antigen would provide useful knowledge for diagnostics and therapeutics development.

The CNN we proposed for this task would consist of one set of kernels of multiple kernel sizes for each receptor chain. The kernels are followed by
ReLU activation and max-pooling to obtain one representation vector per receptor chain. These two vectors are then concatenated and form a unique
receptor representation. This receptor representation is then provided as input for a single linear layer with a single output predicting if a
receptor will bind an antigen or not.

To add a new ML method, we added two classes to the :code:`ml_methods` package:

1. ReceptorCNN class implementing MLMethod interface and
2. PyTorchReceptorCNN class inheriting PyTorch's nn.Module and implementing the forward pass through the network.

The :code:`ReceptorCNN` class is the main class given in the YAML specification when this method is used, while the :code:`PyTorchReceptorCNN` class is PyTorch-specific
implementation. :code:`ReceptorCNN` creates an object of the :code:`PyTorchReceptorCNN` class and takes care of training and predicting class assignment for
training instances. See the documentation and the code for ReceptorCNN at :py:obj:`immuneML.ml_methods.ReceptorCNN.ReceptorCNN` and for PyTorchReceptorCNN at
:py:obj:`immuneML.ml_methods.pytorch_implementations.PyTorchReceptorCNN.PyTorchReceptorCNN`. We also provide a tutorial :ref:`How to add a new machine learning method`.

Comparing the ML models and recovered motifs from TCRdist3, GLIPH2 and CNN
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We compared three ML methods to predict if a paired receptor will bind an antigen or not:

1. ReceptorCNN method added in the previous step,
2. k-nearest neighbors classifier based on TCRdist distance between paired receptors, and
3. logistic regression model based on 3-mer frequencies in each chain.

We compared the performance on three datasets described previously. The YAML specification for one of these analysis (for Influenza A, epitope GILGFVFTL)
is available below. In addition to training and comparing the models, we also recovered motifs from each of them to show how we could get some
insight into the inner workings of each method. We used immuneML to extract the motifs from the trained TCRdist-based classifier, logistic regression
model and CNN. Additionally, we exported the data in a format compatible with GLIPH2 from immuneML and used the same data to extract the motifs with
GLIPH2 as for the other models.

To recover the motifs from the ReceptorCNN model, we added a :ref:`KernelSequenceLogo` report to visualize the kernels of the network as information
gain matrices, similar to the work of `Ploenzke and Irizarry 2018 <https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/411934v1>`_. Adding a report to explore machine learning
models is described in the tutorial :ref:`How to add a new report`. Briefly, adding a report to explore the motifs in the CNN was done by implementing and adding
a class that implements the given report, without modifying any other part of the code.

The input data, YAML specifications and results of these comparisons are available in `NIRD research data archive <http://doi.org/10.11582/2021.00009>`_.

YAML specification for training machine learning models and recovering motifs in the GILGFVFTL dataset (note that the ROCCurveSummary was not present in the original
specification and the plots were obtained outside immuneML; it has since been added to immuneML and can be used directly from YAML specification):

GLIPH2 motifs
***************

Running the previous YAML specification will also output the data in GLIPH2-compatible format. To obtain motifs, we filtered the training data
exported in this way for positive examples and provided them as input to GLIPH2 web server available at
`the project website <http://50.255.35.37:8080/>`_. To obtain the motif file, we used GLIPH2 version of the algorithm, reference version 2, CD8
reference, and assumed all amino acids are interchangeable. The file provided as input to GLIPH2, as well as the resulting file, are available in the
`NIRD research data archive <http://doi.org/10.11582/2021.00009>`_.


Results
-------------------------------------------------

We compared the CNN method with the TCRdist-based k-nearest neighbor classifier and logistic regression on a dataset
consisting of epitope-specific and naive TCRŒ±Œ≤ sequences (assumed to be non-epitope-specific).

The resulting ROC curves for the three epitopes (GILGFVFTL, Influenza A; AVFDRKSDAK, Epstein-Barr virus; KLGGALQAK, Cytomegalovirus) are shown below.
Note that these figures were not included in the results deposited in the NIRD research data archive, but the YAML specification above
has been updated to produce these plots.
