   :twitter:title: immuneML: performing analysis on immuneSIM-generated repertoires
   :twitter:description: See how to perform an analysis using immuneML on immune repertoires generated with immuneSIM.
   :twitter:image: https://docs.immuneml.uio.no/_images/immuneSIML.png

This use case will show you how to use immuneML in conjunction with immuneSIM
(`Weber et al. 2020 <https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/36/11/3594/5802461>`_), tunable multi-feature simulation tool of B- and T-cell
receptor repertoires for immunoinformatics benchmarking.

The combined use of these tools enables the user to generate datasets with know signals as a baseline for ML classification. The user
can either input already existing immuneSIM repertoires into the workflow or use a cross-platform metadata file to both simulate datasets and provide
the label information for immuneML input.

For reference, a detailed documentation of immuneSIM including an installation guide `can be found here <https://immunesim.readthedocs.io/en/latest/quickstart.html>`_.
Additionally, example files for this particular workflow are available on the `immuneSIM GitHub <https://github.com/GreiffLab/immuneSIM/tree/master/use_cases/immuneML>`_.
Note: This use case is based on immuneSIM v0.9.0.

Combined workflow with an immuneSIM and immuneML compatible metadata file
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The most efficient way to combine immuneSIM and immuneML is by using a single metadata
file for both the simulation in immuneSIM and training the model in immmuneML. Below an example of a metadata table,
containing parameters for the simulation of immuneSIM repertoires, which can also be used
as metadata in an immuneML workflow.

   :width: 80%


This metadata file (:download:`metadata_full_sim.csv <../_static/files/metadata_full_sim.csv>`) is used by the following immuneSIM script to generate a set of repertoires.
The metadata file can then be fed into immuneML together with the resulting simulated repertoires
as described in the :ref:`How to import data into immuneML` section.

The following R script generates the simulated repertoires using immuneSIM. The script can also be downloaded here: :download:`immuneSIM_for_ML.R <../_static/files/immuneSIM_for_ML.R>`.

  }


Using existing immuneSIM repertoires with immuneML
-----------------------------------------------------

As immuneSIM repertoires use AIRR-compliant column naming, they can be directly fed into
any immuneML workflow using :ref:`AIRR` importer. For this, a metadata file indexing the existing immuneSIM repertoires
and indicating classification relevant labels has to be created.

If the user chooses to write their own using .yaml file, the declaration of :code:`format: AIRR`
in the definition section is sufficient to ensure compatibility with immuneSIM datasets.

Here we show an example of the analysis using immuneSIM-generated repertoires to train a logistic regression and examine the coefficients of the
model.
