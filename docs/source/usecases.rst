   :twitter:description: See tutorials covering different analysis (instructions) covered by immuneML.

In the immuneML manuscript, we showcase immuneMLs functionalities based on three use cases.
The following three sections describe how to reproduce these three use cases:

1. :ref:`Manuscript use case 1: Reproduction of a published study inside immuneML`

2. :ref:`Manuscript use case 2: Extending immuneML with a deep learning component for predicting antigen specificity of paired receptor data`

3. :ref:`Manuscript use case 3: Benchmarking ML methods on ground-truth synthetic data`

..
    immuneML supports import from multiple different data formats and export into AIRR-C format (MIAIRR standard), which enables post analysis by AIRR-compliant third-party tools.

To see how immuneML can be used in combination with other tools, see the following examples:

#. :ref:`Integration use case: post-analysis of sequences with Immcantation`

#. :ref:`Integration use case: post-analysis of sequences with immunarch`

#. :ref:`Integration use case: Performing analysis on immuneSIM-generated repertoires`
