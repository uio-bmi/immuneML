.. note::

  When adding new features to immuneML, some utility classes are already available. For instance, to construct a path, you can use :code:`PathBuilder.build_from_objects()` function.
  If you need to validate some parameters when constructing an object in :code:`build_object()` functions, for example, you can use :code:`ParameterValidator` class.
  For the full list of such classes, see the `util` package.
