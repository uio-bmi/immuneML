To get started with immuneML, there are four options:

1. Using immuneML from Galaxy (no programming experience required, the functionality is available through a web interface, see :ref:`immuneML & Galaxy`).

2. Using immuneML with Docker (:ref:`Setting up immuneML with Docker`)

3. Installing immuneML with a package manager and using it locally (:ref:`Install immuneML with a package manager`),

4. Cloning the codebase from GitHub repository and running it directly from source code (for development purposes).

Once immuneML has been set up, you can look into :ref:`Quickstart` or look into which analyses you can run with immuneML (see :ref:`Tutorials`).
