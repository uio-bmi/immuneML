To get started with immuneML, there are four options:

1. Using `immuneML through Galaxy <https://galaxy.immuneml.uio.no>`_ (no installation or programming experience required, see :ref:`immuneML & Galaxy`).

2. Using immuneML with Docker (:ref:`Setting up immuneML with Docker`)

3. Installing immuneML with a package manager and using it locally (:ref:`Install immuneML with a package manager`),

4. Cloning the codebase from the `GitHub repository <https://github.com/uio-bmi/immuneML/>`_ and running it directly from source code (for development purposes, see :ref:`Set up immuneML for development`).

Once immuneML has been set up, you can look into :ref:`Quickstart` or look into which analyses you can run with immuneML (see :ref:`Tutorials`).
