The purpose of the Quickstart tutorial is to help new users get started with running immuneML as quickly as possible.
You will find a step-by-step guide on how to use immuneML for a simple machine learning analysis on an adaptive immune receptor repertoire (AIRR) dataset.

The quickest way for a first-time user to try out immuneML is through our Galaxy interface. Watch this video to see how to perform a simple repertoire classification task in Galaxy.

To try out immuneML for yourself, follow one of the Quickstart tutorials. For immunologists without a machine learning background, we recommend following this tutorial:

- :ref:`Quickstart: Galaxy with button-based tools`

Alternatively, if you want to have full control over your immuneML analysis (equivalent to the command line), see:

- :ref:`Quickstart: Galaxy with YAML-based tools`

Lastly, this quickstart tutorial can be used when you have immuneML :ref:`installed <Installing immuneML>` locally:

- :ref:`Quickstart: command-line interface with YAML`

For simulation purposes, you can try LIgO quickstart:

- :ref:`Simulation quickstart`
