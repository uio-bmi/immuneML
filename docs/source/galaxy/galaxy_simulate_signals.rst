The Galaxy tool `Simulate immune events into an existing repertoire dataset <https://galaxy.immuneml.uio.no/root?tool_id=immuneml_simulation>`_
can be used to implant short disease-associated motifs into an existing
Repertoire dataset. Such a dataset with simulated immune signals can be used to benchmark different ML methods.
Any type of repertoire dataset (experimental or simulated) can be used as a starting point for an immune event simulation, as long as it contains amino acid sequences.

If you instead want to simulate a synthetic dataset from scratch, start by :ref:`simulating an AIRR dataset in Galaxy <How to simulate an AIRR dataset in Galaxy>`.

An example Galaxy history showing how to use this tool `can be found here <https://galaxy.immuneml.uio.no/u/immuneml/h/simulate-signals>`_.

Creating the YAML specification
---------------------------------------------

The Galaxy tool takes in an immuneML dataset from the history and a YAML specification.

In the YAML specification, the :ref:`Simulation` instruction must be used. Additionally, the elements
:code:`motifs`, :code:`signals` and :code:`simulations` must be defined in the :code:`definitions` section of the YAML specification.
A :ref:`motif <Motif>` describes a short amino acid sequence (motif seed) which may be implanted into an immune receptor sequence with small modifications.
A :ref:`signal <Signal>` is a group of motifs, and may for example represent a disease. A simulation consists of :ref:`implantings <Implanting>`, which each represent
one or more signals. This can be used to simulate confounding factors (signals occurring together), or ensure signals do not overlap between repertoires.

These elements are described in more detail in :ref:`YAML specification of the Simulation instruction for introducing immune signals`.

This figure shows how the different concepts in a Simulation relate to each other:

When writing an analysis specification for Galaxy, it can be assumed that all selected files are present in the current working directory. A path
to an additional file thus consists only of the filename.
A complete YAML specification for immune event simulation in Galaxy is show here:

Tool output
---------------------------------------------
This Galaxy tool will produce the following history elements:

- Summary: immune signal simulation: a HTML page describing general characteristics of the dataset, including the name of the dataset
  (this name should be specified when importing the dataset later in immuneML), the dataset type and size, and the details of the
  simulated immune signals.

- Archive: immune signal simulation: a .zip file containing the complete output folder as it was produced by immuneML. This folder
  contains the output of the Simulation instruction including all raw data files.
  Furthermore, the folder contains the complete YAML specification file for the immuneML run, the HTML output and a log file.

- immuneML dataset with simulated immune events: Galaxy collection containing all relevant files for the new dataset.
