To be able to run any possible YAML-based immuneML analysis in Galaxy, the tool `Run immuneML with YAML specification <https://galaxy.immuneml.uio.no/root?tool_id=immune_ml>`_ should be used.
It is typically recommended to use the analysis-specific Galaxy tools for :ref:`creating datasets <How to make an immuneML dataset in Galaxy>`,
:ref:`simulating synthetic data <How to simulate an AIRR dataset in Galaxy>`,
:ref:`implanting synthetic immune signals <How to simulate immune events into an existing AIRR dataset in Galaxy>` or
:ref:`training <How to train ML models in Galaxy>` and :ref:`applying <How to apply previously trained ML models to a new AIRR dataset in Galaxy>` ML models instead of this tool.
These other tools are able to export the relevant output files to Galaxy history elements.

However, when you want to run the :ref:`ExploratoryAnalysis` instruction, or other analyses that do not have a corresponding Galaxy tool, this generic tool can be used.

An example Galaxy history showing how to use this tool `can be found here <https://galaxy.immuneml.uio.no/u/immuneml/h/exploratory-analysis>`_.


Creating the YAML specification
---------------------------------------------

This Galaxy tool takes as input an immuneML dataset from the Galaxy history, optional additional files, and a YAML specification file.
To see the details on how to write the YAML specification, see :ref:`How to specify an analysis with YAML`.

When writing an analysis specification for Galaxy, it can be assumed that all files selected under 'Additional files' are present in the current working directory. A path
to an additional file thus consists only of the filename.

The following YAML specification shows an example of how to run the ExploratoryAnalysis instruction inside Galaxy:


.. highlight:: yaml
.. code-block:: yaml

  definitions:
    datasets:
      dataset: # user-defined dataset name
        format: ImmuneML # the default format used by the 'Create dataset' galaxy tool is ImmuneML
        params:
          path: dataset.iml_dataset # specify the dataset name, the default name used by
                                    # the 'Create dataset' galaxy tool is dataset.iml_dataset
    encodings:
      my_regex_matches:
        MatchedRegex:
          motif_filepath: regex_file.tsv # this file must be selected from the galaxy history as an 'additional file'

    reports:
      my_seq_lengths: SequenceLengthDistribution # reports without parameters
      my_matches: Matches

  instructions:
    my_instruction: # user-defined instruction name
      type: ExploratoryAnalysis
      analyses:
        my_analysis_1: # user-defined analysis name
          dataset: dataset
          report: my_seq_lengths
        my_analysis_2:
          dataset: dataset
          encoding: my_regex_matches
          report: my_matches

Where the file :download:`regex_file.tsv <../_static/files/regex_file.tsv>` must be a tab-separated file, which may contain the following contents:

====  ==========
id    TRB_regex
====  ==========
1     ACG
2     EDNA
3     DFWG
====  ==========

Tool output
---------------------------------------------
This Galaxy tool will produce the following history elements:

- Summary: immuneML analysis: a HTML page that allows you to browse through all results.

- ImmuneML Analysis Archive: a .zip file containing the complete output folder as it was produced by immuneML. This folder
  contains the output of the instruction that was used, including all raw data files.
  Furthermore, the folder contains the complete YAML specification file for the immuneML run, the HTML output and a log file.
