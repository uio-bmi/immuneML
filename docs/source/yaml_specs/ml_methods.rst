ML method parameters
=======================

Under the :code:`definitions/ml_methods` component, the user can specify different ML methods to use on a given (encoded) dataset.

From version 3, immuneML includes different types of ML methods:

- :ref:`**Classifiers**` which make predictions about labelled data.
- :ref:`**Clustering methods**` which can cluster unlabelled data.
- :ref:`**Generative models**` to generate new AIR sequences.
- :ref:`**Dimensionality reduction methods**` to reduce the dimensionality of the data before analysing it.
