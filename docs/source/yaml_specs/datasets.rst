Dataset parameters
=======================


Under the :code:`definitions/datasets` component, the user can specify how to import a dataset from files.
The file format determines which importer should be used, as listed below. See also: :ref:`How to import data into immuneML`.

For testing purposes, it is also possible to generate a random dataset instead of importing from files, using
:ref:`RandomReceptorDataset`, :ref:`RandomSequenceDataset` or :ref:`RandomRepertoireDataset` import types.
See also: :ref:`How to generate a dataset with random sequences`.
