How to simulate antigen/disease-associated signals in AIRR datasets
=====================================================================

YAML specification of the Simulation instruction for introducing immune signals
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In immuneML, it is possible to implant signals in a repertoire dataset in order to simulate the effect of an immune event on the repertoires. This is
done using the Simulation instruction in the YAML specification. Any type of repertoire dataset (experimental or simulated) can be used as a starting
oint for an immune event simulation.

The YAML definition consists of three components: motif, signal and simulation definitions.

**Motifs** are defined by (i) the seed (sequence of amino acids), (ii) the way they are instantiated from the seed and (iii) a list of parameters for
the instantiation. For gapped k-mer instantiation, the parameters are Hamming distance probabilities (probability for every distance value is
explicitly given, the gap positions will not be taken into account), minimal and maximal gap size (if a gap is specified in the seed) and alphabet weights
(probability for each amino acid to replace one of the amino acids in the seed when the Hamming distance between the seed and the motif instance is equal
to or larger than 1). It is possible to define multiple motifs by defining a key before specifying the parameters of the motif.

**Signals** model immune events and represent the labels assigned to the repertoires (the label is signal_my_signal_name for signal called
`my_signal_name` in the YAML specification and can have value True or False in the repertoire depending whether the signal was implanted in the repertoire
or not). A signal is defined by a list of motifs (only motif keys as given in the previous section are specified in the list), the sequence position
weights (probabilities to implant a motif instance into a target receptor sequence at the given IMGT position) and implanting (the way receptor
sequences are chosen for implanting from the repertoire). Implanting and the list of motifs are mandatory fields in the YAML specification.

**Simulation** defines how the signals will be combined and implanted in the repertoires. Within a simulation, one or more implantings can be specified.
Each implanting only affects its own partition of the dataset, so each repertoire can only receive implanted signals from one implanting. This way,
implantings can be used to ensure signals do not overlap (one implanting per signal), or to ensure signals always occur together (multiple signals
per implanting).

For each implanting, it is necessary to define dataset implanting rate (the percentage of repertoires in the dataset which will contain the listed
signals), repertoire implanting rate (the percentage of receptor sequences in the repertoire which will contain the listed signals) and a list of
signals for which this applies.

When multiple signals are specified within one implanting, these signals are implanted in the same repertoires. However, they are not implanted within
the same receptors in those repertoires. When specifying multiple different implantings, keep in mind that the summed dataset implanting rate can
not exceed 1.

An example of a simulation with disease-associated signals is given below. In this example, the healthy individuals are here represented by a
randomly generated synthetic dataset (see: :ref:`How to generate a random immune receptor repertoire dataset`). It is also possible to use experimental datasets as a
baseline for the simulation.
