Analyses in immuneML are specified through a YAML specification file with a fixed structure.
Depending on the specification, immuneML can execute different tasks, such as training ML models for receptor or repertoire
classification, simulate data or perform exploratory analyses.
For all the options that can be specified, see :ref:`YAML specification`.


Structure of the analysis specification
---------------------------------------

The analysis specification consists of three main parts: :code:`definitions`, :code:`instructions` and :code:`output`.

Specifying Definitions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

:code:`definitions` refer to components, which will be used within the instructions. They include:

- :code:`datasets`: specifying where data is located, what format the data is in, and how it should be imported (see :ref:`How to import data into immuneML` for more details),

- :code:`preprocessing_sequences`: defining one or more preprocessing steps to be taken on the dataset (this is optional),

- :code:`encodings`: different data representations,

- :code:`ml_methods`: different machine learning methods (e.g., SVM or KNN),

- :code:`reports`: specific plots or statistics to apply to the raw or encoded data, ML methods or results.

Simulation-specific components (only relevant when running a :ref:`Simulation instruction<How to simulate antigen or disease-associated signals in AIRR datasets>`) are:

- :code:`motifs`: parts of the simulation definition defined by a seed and a way to create specific motif instances from the seed,

- :code:`signals`: parts of the simulation which can include multiple motifs and correspond to a single label for subsequent classification tasks,

- :code:`simulations`: define how to combine different signals and how to implant them in the dataset.


Under definitions, each analysis sub-component is defined using a user-specifiable key.
In the examples below, we will use the prefix 'my\_' to identify these keys, but in practice it is possible
to specify any kind of name here. These keys are unique names that identify the settings for a component, and they are
later on referenced in the :ref:`instructions <Specifying Instructions>`
(for example: to specify which of the imported datasets to use in a given instruction).


The :ref:`import of two datasets <How to import data into immuneML>` may be defined as follows:

.. highlight:: yaml
.. code-block:: yaml

  definitions:
    datasets:
      my_repertoire_dataset: # user-defined key for the first dataset
        format: AIRR         # import of a repertoire dataset
        params:
          path: path/to/first/data/
          metadata_file: path/to/first/metadata.csv
      my_receptor_dataset: # user-defined key for the second dataset
        format: AIRR       # import of a receptor dataset
        params:
          path: path/to/second/data/
          is_repertoire: false
          paired: true
          receptor_chains: TRA_TRB
          metadata_column_mapping:          # map column names of the file to label names
            epitope_column_name: my_epitope # my_epitope can be used as label

Where the imported datasets can under :code:`instructions` be referenced using the keys :code:`my_repertoire_dataset` and :code:`my_receptor_dataset`.
Note that in practice, most analyses use just one dataset.

An example of a full :code:`definitions` section which may be used for a machine learning task is given below.
See also :ref:`How to train and assess a receptor or repertoire-level ML classifier` for more details.

.. highlight:: yaml
.. code-block:: yaml

  definitions:
    datasets: # every instruction uses a dataset
      my_dataset:
        format: AIRR
        params:
          path: path/to/data/
          metadata_file: path/to/metadata.csv
    preprocessing_sequences:
      my_preprocessing:
        - my_beta_chain_filter:
            ChainRepertoireFilter:
              keep_chain: TRB
    ml_methods:
      my_log_reg: LogisticRegression
      my_svm: SVM
    encodings:
      my_kmer_freq_encoding_1: KmerFrequency # KmerFrequency with default parameters
      my_kmer_freq_encoding_2: # KmerFrequency with user-defined parameters
        KmerFrequency:
          k: 5
    reports:
      my_seq_length_distribution: SequenceLengthDistribution

The :code:`definitions` section used for Simulation contains different components, as shown in the example below.
See also :ref:`How to simulate antigen or disease-associated signals in AIRR datasets` for more details.

.. highlight:: yaml
.. code-block:: yaml

  definitions:
    datasets: # every instruction uses a dataset
      my_dataset:
        format: AIRR
        params:
          path: path/to/data/
          metadata_file: path/to/metadata.csv
    motifs:
      my_simple_motif:
        seed: AAA
        instantiation: GappedKmer
    signals:
      my_simple_signal:
        motifs:
          - my_simple_motif
        implanting: HealthySequence
    simulations:
      my_simulation:
        my_implanting:
          signals:
            - my_simple_signal
          dataset_implanting_rate: 0.5
          repertoire_implanting_rate: 0.1

A diagram of all the different dataset types, preprocessing steps, encodings, ML methods and reports, and how they can be
combined in different analyses is shown below. The solid lines represent components that are intended to be used together, and the
dashed lines indicate optional combinations.

Specifying Instructions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


Similarly to analysis components, :code:`instructions` are defined under a user-specifiable key.
Under this key, you should define the instruction :code:`type`, which defines the type
of analysis that will be done. All other settings are instruction-specific.

Some of the possible instruction types are (see :ref:`Instructions` for the complete list):

- :ref:`TrainMLModel`

- :ref:`ExploratoryAnalysis`

- :ref:`Simulation`

The components defined under definitions can be referenced inside the instruction, but anything generated from the
instructions is not available to other instructions. If the output of one instruction needs to be used in another
other instruction, two separate immuneML runs need to be made (e.g, running immuneML once with the Simulation
instruction to generate a dataset, and subsequently using that dataset as an input to a second immuneML
run to train a ML model).

An example of the YAML specification for the TrainMLModel instruction is shown below.
See the tutorial :ref:`How to train and assess a receptor or repertoire-level ML classifier` for more explanation behind all settings.

.. highlight:: yaml
.. code-block:: yaml

  instructions:
    my_instruction: # user-defined instruction key
      type: TrainMLModel
      dataset: my_dataset # reference dataset from definitions
      labels: [disease]
      settings: # settings are made up of preprocessing (optional), ml_method and encoding
      - encoding: my_kmer_freq_encoding_1
        ml_method: my_log_reg
      - preprocessing: my_preprocessing
        encoding: my_kmer_freq_encoding_2
        ml_method: my_svm
      assessment:
        split_strategy: random
        split_count: 1
        training_percentage: 70
        reports:
          data_splits: [my_seq_length_distribution]
      selection:
        split_strategy: k_fold
        split_count: 5
      strategy: GridSearch
      metrics: [accuracy]
      optimization_metric: accuracy
      reports: null # no reports
      refit_optimal_model: False
      number_of_processes: 4

Specifying output
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The third and final section of the YAML specification is :code:`output`, which currently only supports one :code:`format`: :code:`HTML`.
The :code:`output` section may be omitted from the YAML, but if included, it should look like this:

.. highlight:: yaml
.. code-block:: yaml

  output:
    format: HTML


Putting all parts together
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

An example of a complete YAML specification for training an ML model through nested cross-validation is given here:

          path: path/to/data/
    preprocessing_sequences:
      my_preprocessing:
        - my_beta_chain_filter:
            ChainRepertoireFilter:
              keep_chain: TRB

Running the specified analysis
------------------------------

To run an instruction via command line with the given YAML specification file:

.. code-block:: console

  immune-ml path/to/specification.yaml result/folder/path/

Alternatively, create an ImmuneMLApp object in a Python script and pass it the path parameter to the constructor before calling its :code:`run()` method as follows:

.. highlight:: python
.. code-block:: python

  from source.app.ImmuneMLApp import ImmuneMLApp

  app = ImmuneMLApp(specification_path="path/to/specification.yaml", result_path="result/folder/path/")
  app.run()
