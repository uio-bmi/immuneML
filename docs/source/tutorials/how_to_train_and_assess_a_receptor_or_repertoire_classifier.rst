immuneML provides a rich set of functionality for training and assessing machine learning models to classify of receptors
or repertoires. This is done using the :ref:`TrainMLModel` instruction.
The goal of the training process is to learn the parameters for a given ML model that result in the most accurate predictions.
Furthermore, we want to select the optimal settings for hyperparameters, which are tunable characteristics of an ML model which
influence the training process and can not automatically be learned by training.

Aside from the hyperparameters of the ML models themselves, the choices made for preprocessing or filtering of the dataset,
as well as the encoding and its parameters will influence the performance of the trained ML model. Therefore, preprocessing steps
and encoding are treated as hyperparameters during ML model training, enabling automatic optimization and unbiased assessment of these choices.

To learn the parameters and hyperparameters of the ML model, the data needs to be split into training, validation and test sets.
Models with different hyperparameters are trained on the training set, then assessed on the separate validation set to find
the optimal hyperparameters, and finally tested on the test set to estimate the model performance.
The resulting optimized classifier can also afterwards be applied to further datasets
(see: :ref:`How to apply previously trained ML models to a new dataset`).
This process is shown in the figure below:

YAML specification of TrainMLModel
------------------------------------------------------------------

Definitions section
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When running the :ref:`TrainMLModel` instruction, the :code:`definitions` part of the YAML specification should at
least contain :code:`datasets`, :code:`encodings` and :code:`ml_methods` components. Optionally, :code:`preprocessing_sequences`
and :code:`reports` may be defined. For detailed descriptions of how the parameters for each of these components are defined,
please refer to the :ref:`YAML specification` documentation. Under :ref:`Definitions` each analysis component is documented
and settings are described.

For importing a dataset, see :ref:`How to import data into immuneML` and for more details on writing the YAML specification, see :ref:`How to specify an analysis with YAML`.

An example of the definitions section using a repertoire dataset is given here:


.. highlight:: yaml
.. code-block:: yaml

  definitions:
    datasets: # every instruction uses a dataset
      my_dataset:
        format: AIRR
        params:
          path: path/to/repertoires/
          metadata_file: path/to/metadata.csv

    preprocessing_sequences:
      my_preprocessing: # user-defined preprocessing name
        - my_beta_chain_filter:
            ChainRepertoireFilter:
              keep_chain: TRB

    ml_methods:
      my_svm:       # example ML method with user-defined settings
        SVM:        # Here, a third level of 3-fold cross-validation is used
          penalty:  # to determine the optimal hyperparameters for 'C' and 'penalty'
            - l1    # This functionality is only available for scikit-learn classifiers
            - l2
          C:
           - 0.01
           - 0.1
           - 1
           - 10
           - 100
        model_selection_cv: True
        model_selection_n_folds: 3
      my_log_reg: LogisticRegression # example ML method with default settings

    encodings:
      my_kmer_freq_encoding:
        KmerFrequency:
          k: 3

    reports:
      my_coefficients: Coefficients
      my_sequence_lengths: SequenceLengthDistribution
      my_performance: MLSettingsPerformance


When choosing which ML method(s) are most suitable for your use-case, please consider the following table.
The table describes which of the ML methods can be used for binary classification (two classes per label), and which
can be used for multi-class classification. Note that all classifiers can automatically be used for multi-label classification
in immuneML.
Furthermore, it describes what type of dataset the classifier can be applied to, and whether a third level of nested cross-validation
can be used for the selection of model parameters (scikit-learn classifiers).

Instructions section
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The YAML specification of the :ref:`TrainMLModel` instruction contains various different components.
Firstly, we should give our instruction a unique name and set the :code:`type`:

.. highlight:: yaml
.. code-block:: yaml

  instructions:
    my_instr:
      type: TrainMLModel
      ... # other parameters should be added here


Furthermore, we should define which :code:`dataset` to train the models on, and which :code:`labels` to predict.
The labels are defined based on the metadata file (repertoire datasets) or metadata column mapping (sequence or receptor datasets),
see :ref:`How to import data into immuneML` for details.
In most cases there will only be one label, but it is possible to specify multiple labels in order to train
multiple different classifiers.

.. highlight:: yaml
.. code-block:: yaml

      dataset: my_dataset
      labels:
        - disease_1
        - disease_2



In the :code:`settings` section the different combinations of ML settings must be specified. They consist of
an :code:`encoding`, an :code:`ml_method` and optional :code:`preprocessing` (only available for repertoire datasets),
which should be referenced by the names that were used to defined them under :code:`definitions`.

Not every combination of encodings and ML methods is valid. For all the valid options, see the figure in the :ref:`YAML specification` documentation.
An example of the settings section of the instruction is:

.. highlight:: yaml
.. code-block:: yaml

  settings:
    - encoding: my_kmer_freq_encoding # Testing my_kmer_freq_encoding in combination with
      ml_method: my_log_reg           # my_log_reg and my_svm, with and without my_preprocessing
    - encoding: my_kmer_freq_encoding
      ml_method: my_svm
    - preprocessing: my_preprocessing # preprocessing can only be defined for repertoire datasets
      encoding: my_kmer_freq_encoding
      ml_method: my_log_reg
    - preprocessing: my_preprocessing
      encoding: my_kmer_freq_encoding
      ml_method: my_svm

Nested cross-validation consists of two loops:

- the inner :code:`selection` loop, which is used to select the optimal hyperparameter settings using the validation set(s)

- the outer :code:`assessment` loop, which is used to give an unbiased assessment of the trained models using the test set(s)

Both for the :code:`selection` and :code:`assessment` loops, we need to define what splitting strategy should be used for the data.
The parameters that should be defined under :code:`selection` and :code:`assessment` are described in the :ref:`SplitConfig`
documentation.
Optionally, it is possible to specify various types of :code:`reports` here (for more details see :ref:`ReportConfig`):

- :code:`models`: `ML model reports <https://docs.immuneml.uio.no/specification.html#ml-model-reports>`_ which will be applied to all compatible models in the given loop.

- :code:`encoding`: `Encoding reports <https://docs.immuneml.uio.no/specification.html#encoding-reports>`_ which will be applied to the encoded data of a given split (all data or training+validation data)

- :code:`data`: `Data reports <https://docs.immuneml.uio.no/specification.html#data-reports>`_ which will be applied to the complete dataset of a given split (all data or training+validation data)

- :code:`data_splits`: `Data reports <https://docs.immuneml.uio.no/specification.html#data-reports>`_ which will be applied to the data splits (training/validation or training+validation/test splits)

The following example shows a piece of the YAML specification when two different splitting strategies are
used for both loops:

.. highlight:: yaml
.. code-block:: yaml

      assessment:                # example defining 5-fold cross-validation
        split_strategy: k_fold
        split_count: 5
        reports:
          models:                # plot the coefficients of the trained models
          - my_coefficients
          data:                  # run this report on all data
          - my_sequence_lengths
      selection:                 # example defining 3-fold monte carlo cross-validation with
        split_strategy: random   # 70% randomly chosen training data per split
        split_count: 3
        training_percentage: 0.7
        reports:                 # run this report on training/validation splits
          data_splits:
          - my_sequence_lengths

Furthermore, the :code:`optimization_metric` and search :code:`strategy` (used to determine optimal hyperparameters) must be set.
Currently, *GridSearch* is the only supported search :code:`strategy`. Aside from the :code:`optimization_metric`, other performance
:code:`metrics` can also be computed for reference. And the user needs to decide whether the optimal ML settings should be
retrained on the complete dataset (including test set) after assessment through setting the parameter :code:`refit_optimal_model`.

The following YAML example shows how these parameters are defined:

.. highlight:: yaml
.. code-block:: yaml

      optimization_metric: balanced_accuracy # the metric used for optimization
      metrics: # other metrics to compute
      - accuracy
      - auc
      strategy: GridSearch
      refit_optimal_model: False

:ref:`Train ML model reports` summarizing the performance of multiple different models should be set under :code:`reports`.
And finally, the :code:`number_of_processes` used for parallelization should be set.

.. highlight:: yaml
.. code-block:: yaml

      reports:
      - my_performance
      number_of_processes: 4
