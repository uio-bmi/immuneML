How to train and assess a receptor/repertoire-level ML classifier
==================================================================

immuneML provides a rich set of functionality for learning and assessing machine
learning models (classifiers of receptors or repertoires). To learn the parameters and hyperparameters of the ML model,
the data needs to be split into training, validation and test sets. For this splitting, both nested cross-validation and fixed splits are supported.
Processing and filtering choices for input receptor data,
as well as encoding choice, can be set up as hyperparameters for automatic optimization
and unbiased assessment across such choices. One can set up a single immuneML run to train
models, optimize hyperparameters and get an unbiased assessment of its performance.
The resulting optimized classifier can also afterwards be applied to further datasets.
This process is shown in the figure below.

See :ref:`How to properly train and assess an ML model` to learn more about model training, hyperparameters and unbiased assessment.

  Overview of the training process of an ML classifier: hyperparameter
  optimization is done on training and validation data and the model performance is
  assessed on test data

The analysis specification consists of (i) defining all elements used for analysis,
such as the dataset, encodings, preprocessing, ML methods and reports, (ii) defining
the instruction to be executed. Training ML model instructions take as parameters:

1. A list of hyperparameter settings (preprocessing, encoding, ML method combinations) to be evaluated,

.. highlight:: yaml
.. code-block:: yaml
  :linenos:

  settings:
    - encoding: my_kmer_enc
      ml_method: my_log_reg
    - preprocessing: filter1
      encoding: my_kmer_enc
      ml_method: my_svm

2. Assessment configuration, including:

  2.1. How to split the data in the outer cross-validation loop,

  2.2. How many combinations of training/test datasets to generate based on the given
  splitting strategy,

  2.3. What percentage of data to use for the training dataset (if splitting to training and test is random),

  2.4. Reports to execute:

    2.4.1. **hyperparameter**: reports to be executed after the nested CV has finished to show the overall performance

    2.4.2. **models**: reports  to be generated for optimal models per label

    2.4.3. **data**: reports to be executed on the whole dataset before it is split to training and test

    2.4.4. **data_splits**: reports to be executed after the data has been split into training and test

    2.4.5. **encoding**: reports to be executed on the encoded training and test datasets

  .. highlight:: yaml
  .. code-block:: yaml
    :linenos:

    assessment:
      split_strategy: random
      split_count: 5
      training_percentage: 0.7
      reports:
        hyperparameter:
          - my_hp_benchmark
        models:
          - my_model_report
        data:
          - my_data_report
        data_splits:
          - my_data_report
        encoding:
          - my_encoding_report

3. Selection configuration, including:

  3.1. How to split the data in the inner cross-validation loop,

  3.2. How many combinations of train/test datasets to generate based on the strategy,

  3.3. What percentage of data to use for the training dataset (the remaining will be used for validation),

  3.4. Reports to execute:

    2.4.1. **models**: reports to be executed on all trained classifiers

    2.4.2. **data**: reports to be executed on the training dataset split before it is split to training and validation

    2.4.3. **data_splits**: reports to be executed after the data has been split into training and validation

    2.4.4. **encoding**: reports to be executed on the encoded training and validation datasets

  .. highlight:: yaml
  .. code-block:: yaml
    :linenos:

    selection:
      split_strategy: random
      split_count: 1
      reports:
        models:

        data:
          - my_data_report
        data_splits:
          - my_data_report
        encoding:
          - my_encoding_report
      training_percentage: 0.7

4. A list of labels to use for prediction,

5. A list of metrics for evaluation (e.g., accuracy, balanced accuracy, f1_weightedâ€¦),

6. A metric which will be used for evaluation (given under optimization_metric field)
