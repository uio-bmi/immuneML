Quickstart: command-line interface with YAML
==============================================

This tutorial will show you how to use immuneML for a simple machine learning analysis on an adaptive immune receptor repertoire (AIRR) dataset.
This example dataset consists of 100 synthetic immune repertoires (sequences generated by OLGA), each containing 1000 CDR3 sequences.
In half the repertoires, the subsequence 'VLEQ' has been implanted in 5% of the CDR3 sequences to simulate a disease signal.
Using immuneML, we will encode the data as 3-mer frequencies and try to predict the disease status of each repertoire using logistic regression.


Getting started using the command-line interface
-------------------------------------------------

This tutorial assumes that immuneML is already installed locally (see :ref:`Installing immuneML`).
We recommend :ref:`installing immuneML using a package manager <Install immuneML with a package manager>`.

Step 0: test run immuneML
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This is an optional step.
To quickly test out whether immuneML is able to run, try running the quickstart command:

.. code-block:: console

    immune-ml-quickstart ./quickstart_results/

This will generate a synthetic dataset and run a simple machine machine learning analysis on the generated data.
The results folder will contain two sub-folders: one for the generated dataset and one for the results of the machine
learning analysis. The files named specs.yaml are the input files for immuneML that describe how to generate the dataset
and how to do the machine learning analysis. The index.html files can be used to navigate through all the results that were produced.

Step 1: downloading the dataset
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

An archive containing the dataset used in this tutorial can be downloaded here: :download:`quickstart_data.zip <../_static/files/quickstart_data.zip>`.
It contains the following files:

- The metadata.csv file, which describes which of the 100 repertoires contain the disease signal named 'signal_disease'.

- The 100 repertoire_<somenumber>.tsv, which are synthethic immune repertoire files in AIRR format.


Step 2: writing the YAML specification
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Any immuneML analysis is described by a YAML specification file.
This file contains nested key-value pairs. Mandatory keywords with a specific meaning are marked like :code:`this`
in the text. Note that correct whitespace (not tab) indentation of the yaml file is important.

In this tutorial, we will only cover the essential elements of the YAML specification.
For a more complete introduction, see :ref:`How to specify an analysis with YAML`.

The YAML specification consists of:

- :code:`definitions` describing the analysis components.

  - :code:`datasets`: our data is in :ref:`AIRR` format, we need to provide the location of the repertoires and the metadata file.

  - :code:`encodings`: the data will be represented through a :ref:`k-mer frequency encoding <KmerFrequency>`.
    This means each repertoire is represented based on the frequency of subsequences of length k.
    For example, the sequence CSVQYF contains the 3-mers CSV, SVQ, VQY and QYF.

  - :code:`ml_methods`: we will use :ref:`logistic regression <LogisticRegression>` to classify
    the encoded immune repertoires.

  - Optionally, :code:`reports`: we will plot the :ref:`coefficients <Coefficients>` of the trained
    logistic regression model, to get more insight into what the model has learned.

- :code:`instructions` describing the type of analysis.

  - The :ref:`TrainMLModel` instruction is used to train one or more 'ML settings' (combinations of encodings and ML methods),
    and optimize the hyperparameters using nested cross-validation. We can set the parameters for the outer 'assessment' and
    inner 'selection' cross-validation loops.

The complete YAML specification for this analysis is shown below and can be downloaded here: :download:`quickstart.yaml <../_static/files/quickstart/cli/quickstart.yaml>`.
Make sure to change :code:`path/to/repertoires/` and :code:`path/to/metadata.csv` to the actual paths to the data on your local machine.

    definitions:
      datasets:
        my_dataset: # user-defined dataset name
          format: AIRR
          params:
            is_repertoire: true # we are importing a repertoire dataset
            path: path/to/repertoires/          # path to the folder containing the repertoire .tsv files
            metadata_file: path/to/metadata.csv

      encodings:
        my_kmer_frequency: # user-defined encoding name
          KmerFrequency:   # encoding type
            k: 3           # encoding parameters

      ml_methods:
        my_logistic_regression: LogisticRegression # user-defined ML model name: ML model type (no user-specified parameters)

      reports:
        my_coefficients: Coefficients # user-defined report name: report type (no user-specified parameters)

    instructions:
      my_training_instruction: # user-defined instruction name
        type: TrainMLModel

        dataset: my_dataset # use the same dataset name as in definitions
        labels:
        - signal_disease    # use a label available in the metadata.csv file

        settings: # which combinations of ML settings to run
        - encoding: my_kmer_frequency
          ml_method: my_logistic_regression

        assessment: # parameters in the assessment (outer) cross-validation loop
          reports:  # plot the coefficients for the trained model
            models:
            - my_coefficients
          split_strategy: random   # how to split the data - here: split randomly
          split_count: 1           # how many times (here once - just to train and test)
          training_percentage: 0.7 # use 70% of the data for training

        selection: # parameters in the selection (inner) cross-validation loop
          split_strategy: random
          split_count: 1
          training_percentage: 1 # use all data for training

        optimization_metric: balanced_accuracy # the metric to optimize during nested cross-validation when comparing multiple models
        metrics: # other metrics to compute for reference
        - auc
        - precision
        - recall

        strategy: GridSearch # strategy for hyperparameter optimization, GridSearch is currently the only available option

        reports: []                # optional train ML model reports to run
        number_of_processes: 4     # processes for parallelization
        refit_optimal_model: false # whether to retrain the model on the whole dataset after optimizing hyperparameters
        store_encoded_data: false  # whether to store intermediate encoded data files (increases disk usage)


Step 3: running the analysis
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


Once the YAML specification has been saved to a file (for example: quickstart.yaml), the analysis can be run using the following steps:

#. Activate the virtual environment where immuneML is available.

#. Navigate to the directory where :code:`quickstart_specs.yaml` was saved.

#. Run the following command:

.. code-block:: console
    immune-ml quickstart_specs.yaml ./quickstart_results/


Step 4: understanding the results
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The results folder contains a multitude of files and folders, which can most easily be navigated by opening :code:`./quickstart_results/index.html` in a browser.
This HTML page displays a summary of the analysis, the performance of the optimized ML model (click 'see details' to navigate further), and the report that plots the 25 top coefficients of
the trained logistic regression model. Notice how the coefficients with the highest values are associated with the k-mers 'VLE' and 'LEQ', which overlap with the implanted disease signal 'VLEQ', meaning the ML model learned the correct signal.

In the folder :code:`./quickstart_results/exported_models/` a .zip file can be found containing the configuration of the optimal ML settings, including settings for the encoding
and machine learning method. Using immuneML, these optimal ML settings can subsequently be applied to a new repertoire dataset with unknown disease labels.

The folder :code:`./quickstart_results/my_training_instruction/` contains all raw exported results of the TrainMLModel instruction including all ML model predictions and raw report results.

Finally, :code:`./quickstart_results/` contains the complete YAML specification file for the analysis and a log file.
